## Inspiration
Even though I have hundreds of bookmarks, no more than 20 of them are really useful at the same time.
And I was tired of manage bookmarks from browser to browser. I think my way managing links may not effective enough.
Thus I tried to develop a distributed and erasable bookmarking tool for multi-person collaboration.
## What it does
The ICX is regard as a tool or station, where users can manage bookmarks via Internet Computer.
Edit access to data is open to all inludes modify & delete. A vote is required to decide whether the data will be stored permanently.
## User Guide
1.Click power button at bottom left to switch read/write mode.

2.The node hierarchy is designed as three levels. 

- a.App Node
- b.Collection Node
- C.Bookmark Node

## How we built it
Around 3 weeks, Start with a figma draft of this product, develop backend in motoko and then develop frontend in vue.
## Challenges we ran into
- The identity is hard to get started, luckily I reference to many open source projects and examples.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
### Product
- Feedback is integrated in the service
- Service will stop at every Saturday.
### Not Bad UI : )
- Dark/Light mode
- The Msg-Bot at right bottom for UI Embellishments
- The Human Check Verify Popup
## What we learned
- How to deploy & upgrade dapps on IC.
- Separate front and back-end development on IC.
## What's next for ICX
- Vote for data frozen
- User Profie (maybe ICNS)
